/* Implement a Class called "Person"
 * This will have a member variable firstName and 2 methods, one
 * to get the value of the firstName variable and the other to set it.
 * Your program should create an instance of the class, ask the user to enter his/her name  (var name = window.prompt("Enter your name: ");)
 * and then set this firstName on the class and then retrieve it using the get method and print
 * it out on the console (eg My name is "name")
