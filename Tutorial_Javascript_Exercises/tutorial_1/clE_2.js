/*
Create a Car Class which has 2 private member variables, model and price.
Add a constructor to the class which will initialise these 2 variables
Add a default constructor to the class which will explicitly set the model and price to specific values

Your program will ask the user to supply the model and price of a car and you will
use these to initialise the instance of your car and then using public methods to get the
model and price you will print these out on the console.

Create a new instance of the Car class using the default constructor and again print out the details of
the member variables on the console
