/*
 * Write a Class called TypePrinter that has 4 overloaded methods with the same name,
 * eg "public void printValue(...)"  Each method will take a different type parameter
 * (eg double,int etc).
 *
 * Your program should create an instance of TypePrinter and pass the values of the
 * different types you used into the Method printValue(...). These should then be
 * displayed on the Console
