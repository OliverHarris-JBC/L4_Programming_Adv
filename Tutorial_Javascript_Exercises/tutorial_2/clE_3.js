/*
 * Implement a single inheritance heirachy based on the following statement:
 * A CarPart has a partNumber and a partName. A Tyre is a CarPart and it has a size in inches.
 *
 * Use the appropriate access method to encapsulate the member variables in the base class.
 * The member variable in the derived class can be publically accessible
 *
 * Your program should create the relevant instance of the heirachy, initialising the member variables
 * and printing these out on the console in a single statement, for example:
 * "My car part is a tyre of size 15" and part number PN34572"
