/* To save time copy your code from exercise 1.4 here
 *
 * We now want to extend the multi-level inheritance heirachy your created in 1.4 into
 * one that also supports heirarchical inheritance. Do this based on the following statement:
 *
 * A RacingTyre and a TrailerTyre are specialisations of a Tyre and a Tyre is a
 * specialisation of a CarPart. A TrailerTyre has a weight rating
 *
 * Initialise the new member variable.
 *
 * Now you will now need 2 instances of your heirachy, one for each specilisation of Tyre,
 * with an associated summary statement
