/* A Rectangle, Triangle and Circle are all types of Shape. A Square is a specialisation of a Rectangle
 * and an IsocoleseTriangle and RightAngledTriangle are specialisations of of a Triangle.
 * An Oval is a specialisation of a Circle.
 *
 * Implement these entities in a class inheritance heirarchy.
 * Your implementation should populate the hierachy with shape dimensions that allow the area of each shape to be
 * calculated. A constructor for each object will contain the relevant shape dimensions
 * Hint: you may find you need empty default constructors in some cases
 *
 * Areas of various objects are as follows:
 *
 * square:                width * width
 * rectangle:             width * length
 * isosceles triangle:    0.5 * base * height
 * right angled triangle: 0.5 * base * height
 * circle:                pi * (radius * radius)
 * ellipse:               pi * radius * minor_radius;
 * */
