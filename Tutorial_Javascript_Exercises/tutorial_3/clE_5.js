 *
 * Create a class called Time and let it have 2 integer member variables hours and minutes
 * Initialise these variables in a constructor when you create instances of the time class
 * Oveload the operator "+" to allow the 2 Time instances to be added together and the result
 * held in the 3rd Time instance. Print the result out in the form hh:mm
