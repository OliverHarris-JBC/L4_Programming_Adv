/* SUMMARY:
 * To investigate the valid and invalid ways of casting between objects in inheritance hierarchies

 * Create a Multilevel Inheritance hierarchy (3 levels). Using the following Classes
 * Colour -> Red -> Pink
 * ie Red is a specialisation of Colour and Pink is a specialisation of Red
 *
 * For each class introduce a public integer member variable. Call the variable c in the Colour class, r in the
 * red class and p in the pink class.
 *
 * Create instances of each of the Classes in the hierarchy
 *
 * Try casting these instances upwards as described in the tutorial. Are the results as you expect?
 * Try casting these instances downwards as described in the tutorial . Are the results as you expect?
 *
 * How did you verify that casting downwards is a problem?
 *
