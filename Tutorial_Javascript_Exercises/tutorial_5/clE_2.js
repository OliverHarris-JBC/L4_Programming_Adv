/* SUMMARY:
* Using Function Properties

 * Recreate the  Fridge Class from Exercise 1.1 and give it a member variable called temperature as
 * before that is publically modifyable
 *
 * Now add the code to make this variable accessible as a Function Property
 * In the set routine add some code that will only update the temperature variable if it is the range
 * -20 to 0 degrees.
 *
 * On the console display the result of setting/getting the temperature using in-range and out of range values
 * to verify your code is working as expected
