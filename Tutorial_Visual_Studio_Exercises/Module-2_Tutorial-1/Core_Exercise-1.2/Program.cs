/*
 * Create a Cat Class
 * Think of 4 characteristics that are common to all cats (eg eyeColour, weight etc) and implement these as Class
 * attributes with data access Methods for each one.
 * In addition think of 3 actions that you can do to a cat (tickle, feed etc). Create methods for these actions and
 * place some Console output in these methods that gets displayed when the method is called.
 * 
 * Create an instance of your cat, call it's methods and output a single line on the console which describes
 * the cat's characteristics
