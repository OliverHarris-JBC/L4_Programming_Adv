/*
 * A Bank has Customers which are created when they open an account.
 * 
 * Create Bank and Customer Classes and arrange it such that the Bank Class has a private List of Customers.
 * Customers are created via a Method on the Bank Class called addCustomer(...). On creation the
 * Customer has a name and an opening balance. Create 10 customers (its a small bank) 
 * Your application should provide a method on the Bank Class to print out the list of Customers (eg printCustomers()) 
 * The output will show the customer names and their balances correctly formatted on the display
