/* Create a PetrolPump class with 3 member variables:
 * a static double which holds the price per liter        
 * a double which holds the cost of the customer purchase 
 * a string which holds the pump name (eg "pump 1" etc)
 * 
 * The PetrolPump class will have a method to print out on the console the pump name, its price per liter and 
 * the customer purchase value;
 * 
 * Create instances of 3 PetrolPumps (each with a different name eg pump1, pump2 etc)
 * Initialise the price per litre member variable only for the first pump
 * Initialise the customer purchase price for each pump
 * 
 * Print out the pump data on the console
 * 
 * Finally to demonstrate a static method instead of initialising the static member variable pricePerLitre directly
 do this by adding a static method eg setPricePerLitre and using that approach instead
