/*
 * To save time copy your code from exercise 1.3 here
 * 
 * Implement a multi-level inheritance heirachy based on the following statement:
 * A CarPart has a partNumber and a partName. A Tyre is a CarPart and it has a size in inches. A RacingTyre is a 
 * specialisation of a Tyre, it has a surface characteristic which can be either Hard, soft or slick
 * 
 * Use the appropriate access methods to encapsulate the member variables where appropriate. 
 * The member variable in the derived class can be publically accessible
 * 
 * Your program should create RacingTyre instance, initialising its member variable
 * and printing these out on the console in a single statement as before adding into the statement the new characteristic
