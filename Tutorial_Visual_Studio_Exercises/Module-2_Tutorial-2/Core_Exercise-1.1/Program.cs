/*Create your own Multilevel Inheritance hierarchy with at least 3 levels. Populate each level 
 * with appropriate member variables and Methods
 * Create instances of your hierarchy initialising them as appropriate and printing out on the Console
 * relevant data to show the objects construction and data initialisation.
 * 
 * Add another 2 Classes to create a Multilevel and Hierachical structure and again add variables and Methods
 * to demonstrate via the Console the result of initialisaing and accessing them.
