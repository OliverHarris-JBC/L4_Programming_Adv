/* 
   The value of the mathematical constant PI is 3.14159265358
 
   Write a Class called Pi which has functions void displayPi(...) which takes the following types 
   as a parameter (int, float, double, string )
  
   Your program will create an instance of the Class and call displayPi Method passing in the various types
   you support. Each method will display on the Console the value of Pi in the form it was supplied 
   to the Method.
   You can get the value of Pi using Math.PI
   You will need to force the value to float and int using a cast eg (int)Math.Pi and use the 
   Convert.ToString(Math.Pi) to get it in a string format.
