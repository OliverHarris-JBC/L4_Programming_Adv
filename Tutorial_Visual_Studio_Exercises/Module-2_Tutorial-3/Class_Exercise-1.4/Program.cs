/* Copy the code you produced in the last exercise (1.3) here.
 * A music genre has a year associated with when it first appeared. This will be true for all genres hence there is no default.
 * 
 * Since every derived class must have an implementation this is a candidate for using an abstract method. Use the method name
 * string getYearGenreAppeared() to provide this. For each genre it will simply return the date it first appeared on the music scene.
 * Remember that as soon as one method is abstract the whole class must be abstract.
 * 
 * Extend your console output to print the the year along with the other related data. As an example see below
 * 
 * "Pop, genre first appeared in 1965, hit record: ABBA - Fernando"
 * etc
 * etc
