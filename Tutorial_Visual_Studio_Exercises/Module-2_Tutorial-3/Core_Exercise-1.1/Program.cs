/*
 * TV's, iPad's, Radio's and PC's are all types of Sound Devices ie they support sound output and in some cases sound input.
 * All sound devices have a generic name (eg TV, PC etc)
 * Create an inheritance heirarchy that reflects the above statement. The device name should be initialised via a constructor.
 * 
 * Some of the above devices are capable of supporting microphone input, others are not. Introduce a method, (where appropriate)
 * to return true if the device supports microPhone input. (Hint: You may need a default method for those that don't)
 * 
 * Create a list of devices and iterate round them diplaying the name of the device and if it can support Microphone input or not
 * 
 * Your output will look something like:
 * Sound Device Radio does not support microphone input
 * etc
 * etc
