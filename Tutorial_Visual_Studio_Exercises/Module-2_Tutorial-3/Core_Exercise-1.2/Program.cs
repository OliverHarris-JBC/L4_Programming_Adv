/* All Sound Devices that we considered in Core exercise 1.1 require a power source of a specific voltage but it
 * is different for each device.
 * Copy your previous code here and extend it to introduce a method getVoltageRequirement which returns the specific 
 * voltage requirements for the respective device.
 * 
 * You should output both the device name, its voltage requirements and whether it can support microphone input on the
 * display in a similar to that below
 * 
 * Sound Device TV does not support microphone input. Its' voltage requirement is 240V
