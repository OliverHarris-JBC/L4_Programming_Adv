/*
An employee is paid depending on how many hours he has worked
There are three types of employee, part-time, full-time and contract and they have different rates of pay
(£7.50 for part-time, £8.60 for full-time, £11.00 for contract)


The data is presented in the following form;

Peter Smith, PartTime, 20.5 hours  £20 award 
Sarah Cullen, FullTime, 150.0 hours 10% bonus
Alan Rusty, Contract, 15.0 hours


Parttime and Fulltime staff have a bonus which is a percentage of their total monthly pay

Your program will create the relevant type of employee, and via it's constructor initialise
both the name of the employee and the hours worked. The employees will be held in a List
and the Payroll object will iterate thorough the List and calculate the total payroll amount
displaying this on the console
