/*
Write a program that tries to access an out of bound array element but catches this 
system exception (System.IndexOutOfRangeException) without the program crashing.

Do this by implementing a class that has a method which, when passed a bad array index, will cause
an out of bounds exception to occur. Your program should also handle the working case with a good index value
Print out the value returned on the console so you can see what gets passed back to your program in the good 
and bad cases

Put Console output in the catch and finally parts of the exception handler so you can see on the 
console the order in which things get executed
