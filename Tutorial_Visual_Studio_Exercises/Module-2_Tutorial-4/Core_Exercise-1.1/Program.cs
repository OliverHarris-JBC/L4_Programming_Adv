/* A rocket fuel loading procedure requires that the fuel tank temperature must be between -160 and -170 degress C whilst 
 filling is in progress. An alarm needs to be raised if the temperature detected is outside this range.
 
 The Class RocketFuellingControl manages the fuelling process and has a method setTankTemperature(...) which gets
 updated based on the value from a temperature sensor.
 
 Write the code for the RocketFuellingControl Class and introduce the necessary exception handling to detect and
 report when the exception has arisen. You can supply test temperatures by calling setTankTemperature from your program.
 * 
 * Use System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000); if you want to have a 1 second delay between test values
