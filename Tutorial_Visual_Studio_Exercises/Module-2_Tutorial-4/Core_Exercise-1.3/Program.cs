/* You are asked to design the inheritance hierarchy for some product management software by your software team manager. 
The information you have been given is as follows:

The company that wants the software supplies both hardware and software products to the public. Hardware covers many standard PC parts
eg Power supplies, hard disks, motherboards etc. Software covers games, office software, accounting software and Tools. 
Every product has a Product ID, supplier and supplier price. 
The margin of hardware products and software products are different so the retail price for each product needs this margin adding
onto the supplier price.
Games have a title and can run on one of 3 platforms (PC, XBox, PS4). For each item of hardware there are numerous variants of each category
all from different suppliers.

You should determine an appropriate inheritance hierachy and identify relevant attributes and methods that might be needed and
produce a basic implementation of the hierarchy that compiles successfuly.
