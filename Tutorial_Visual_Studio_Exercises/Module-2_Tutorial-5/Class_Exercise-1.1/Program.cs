/* SUMMARY:
 * Using auto properties
*/
/* STEP 1:
 * Aim: Create a Fridge class and add a member variable
 * 
 * Create a Class Fridge and add a member variable (ie property) temperature
 * Create the auto properties set and get to allow the values for this variable to be changed from your
 * program (You should display on the Console the result of a get after doing a set)
*/
/* STEP 2:
 * Aim: To modify the code such that only the Class Fridge can set the temperature
 * 
 * Change the "set" function to be private and verify that you now only "get" the variable and the
 * compiler indicates that you can't do a "set" from your program.
