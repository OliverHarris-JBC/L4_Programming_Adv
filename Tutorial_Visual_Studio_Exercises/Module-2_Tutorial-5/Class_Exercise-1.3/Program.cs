/* SUMMARY:
   To write an implementation that demonstrates send a "message" between 2 objects
 * 
 * Create 2 classes called GalaxyPhone and NokiaPhone
 * The GalaxyPhone is going to send a text message to the NokiaPhone. To do this the GalaxyPhone will require a member
 * variable which is a reference to the NokiaPhone.
 * The GalaxyPhone will require a method to send the message eg textMessageSend(string message) and the NokiaPhone will require
 * a method to receive the text message eg textMessageReceive(string message)
 * You program should prompt the user to enter a message to send via the GalaxyPhone and the NokiaPhone should print 
 * this message out when it receives it. The message from the GalaxyPhone should have the following format
 * 
 * "Galaxy Phone => Nokia Phone: " + userMessage
 *
